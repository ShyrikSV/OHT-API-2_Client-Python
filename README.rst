Dependencies
------------

requests `here <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_ >= 2.7.0 

Structure
---------

File structure::

  OhtApi2.py/ - contain OHT API implementation class
  test/
    test_oht.py/ - unit tests for OhtApi class
   
For testing used `Travic-CI <https://travis-ci.org/>`_

Some words about testing:
	* Tests save some state information (we know it's not quite right, but creating new projects on OHT server for each test is not quite right as well)
	* There is no mock, because we need to check real answer from server - this class is a part of system, and when server API will be change (if ever) tests will show it.
	* Private and public keys pass as environment variables ('PubKey' and 'PrivKey') - if you fork pass your own keys please.
	
Starters' Guide
---------------

First of all, you must to obtain private and public keys:

1. Register as a customer on `One Hour Translation <https://www.onehourtranslation.com/auth/register>`_
2. Request your `API Keys <https://www.onehourtranslation.com/profile/apiKeys>`_

or use sandbox for playing with API:

1. Register as a customer on `One Hour Translation Sandbox <http://www.sandbox.onehourtranslation.com/auth/register>`_
2. Request your `snadbox API Keys <http://www.sandbox.onehourtranslation.com/profile/apiKeys>`_

Almost each method of **OhtApi** class return namedtuple (with type *oht_response*) with such structure:

**status** - namedtuple:

	*code* - request status code

	*msg* - request status message, "ok" for OK

**results** - namedtuple, fields list depend on kind of query

**errors** - list of errors

For more details see doc comments for each method.

The API Library must be configured before calling any API method:

.. code-block:: python

	>>> from OhtApi2 import OhtApi
	>>> oht = OhtApi(YOUR_PUBLIK_KEY, YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY, True) # True for use sandbox
	>>> print(oht.account_details())
	oht_response(status=oht_response(code=0, msg='ok'), errors=[], results=oht_response(account_username='YOU_ACCOUNT_NAME', credits='98610.5200', role='customer', account_id='YOUR_ID'))
	...

**OhtApi** class has build-in URLs for product and sandbox API or you can change them if need. Whenever instance is created or URL is change, it try to check URL availability.
